# Compose UI Test

There are three main ways to interact with elements:

1. Finders
   - One or multiple element selection (or nodes in the Semantics tree) to make assertions or perform actions on them.
2. Assertions
   - Used to verify that the elements exist or have certain attributes.
3. Actions
   - Inject simulated user events on the elements, such as clicks or other gestures.
